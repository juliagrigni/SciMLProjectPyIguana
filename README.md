# SciMLProjectPyIguana

This project contains the code and data implemented so far for Team PyIguana's project for the Scientific Machine Learning course at Georgia Tech.

The data used can be found in the contents folder, and the Jupyter notebook with code is Model_pipeline.ipynb. As this semester mainly focused on design and not implementation, this has the pipeline for our model, but there is still work remaining before we could obtain good results: hyperparameter tuning, using more of the data, etc.

In terms of the content/data, there is one more source that we were unable to push to GitHub due to size limits, and it can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1llDAT35W4Zo_2qTQIuvajyGVGVcCzpYk/view?usp=sharing). It should be added to the content folder locally before running.

The creation of this code was done on Google Collab, so the contribution history of this repository does *not* reflect the actual contribution history.
